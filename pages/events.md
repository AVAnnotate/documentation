## Events

An “Event” in AVAnnotate can comprise single or multiple AV files and single or multiple sets of annotations. AVAnnotate will create or ingest a [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/) for each event. Event pages can be auto-generated or created by the user.

Select `+ Add` and input information about the new event, including 
- `Label`
- `Item Type`
- `AV label`
- `URL`
- `Duration`
- `Description`
- `Citation`

AVAnnotate projects can be created without links to audio via
- Spreadsheet upload – users will have to fill out audio or video in the spreadsheet and will be prompted to enter durations; enter any number and continue
- Manually by changing the File from URL to Offline
