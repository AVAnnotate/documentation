## Events

An “Event” in AVAnnotate can comprise single or multiple AV files and single or multiple sets of annotations. AVAnnotate will create or ingest a [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/) for each event. Event pages can be auto-generated or created by the user.

Select “Add,” and input information about the new event, including the event label; item type (audio or video); AV label, URL, and duration; description; and citation. For more information, see [Events](events.md).
