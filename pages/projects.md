# Projects
AVAnnotate projects serve a variety of purposes, including exhibits and editions, class projects, or as interfaces for discovering archival audiovisual collections. This "Projects" section provides technical instructions for developing an AVAnnotate project, including the major project components (events, tags, and annotations) and the different types of pages that can be added to include contextual essays that are either auto-generated or custom-made. For more information about creating projects, see the accompanyinmg pages at [User Guidelines and Resources](https://avannotate.github.io/guidelines/).
