# Projects
This "Projects" section provides instructions for developing an AVAnnotate project, including the major project components (events, tags, and annotations), alongside the different types of pages that can be added to include contextual essays that are either auto-generated or custom-made. AVAnnotate projects serve a variety of purposes, including exhibits and editions, class projects, or as interfaces for discovering archival audiovisual collections.
