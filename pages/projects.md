# Projects
AVAnnotate projects are sometimes used as exhibits or editions, as class projects or as interfaces for discovering archival AV collections. 
- Projects can be saved in any organization that a user has permission to access in GitHub.
- Collaborators can be added on the `Project Settings` page through a search for GitHub usernames.
