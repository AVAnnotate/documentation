## Projects
AVAnnotate projects are sometimes used as exhibits or editions, as class projects or as interfaces for discovering archival AV collections. 
- Projects can be saved in any organization that a user has permission to access in GitHub.
- Collaborators can be added on the `Project Settings` page through a search for GitHub usernames.

# Creating Projects
Select `+ Add` and input information about the new project, including 
- `Title`
- `Description`
- `Language`
- ` Project Slug`
- `Project Authors`
- `Collaborators`

# Creating Offline Projects
AVAnnotate projects can be downloaded and used offline or on a private server as a free-standing site. See [Offline Projects](offline.md).
- Offline / private projects with up to 3 collaborators can be created using GH private repos. See [Private Projects](private.md).
- For projects containing offline AV, see [AV Formats and Support](av.md).
