# Adding AVAnnotate Collaborators
Steps for including collaborators on projects:
1. Determine the collaborator's GitHub username.
2. In the AVAnnotate `Projects` dashboard, select the desired project from `My Projects`, open the project settings from the three-dot menu, navigate to `Collaborators`, and select `Add Collaborator`.
3. Enter the collaborator's GitHub username. The collaborator will receive an email from GitHub with an invitation to the repository.
4. After accepting the invitation from GitHub, the project will appear under the `Shared Projects` tab in the collaborator's AVAnnotate `Projects` dashboard.
5. The added user has the ability to add, edit, and delete all project components.
