# Adding AVAnnotate Collaborators
Steps for including collaborators on projects:
1. Determine the collaborator's GitHub username.
3. In the AVAnnotate dashboard, open the project settings and navigate to `Users`, select `Add`.
4. Enter the collaborator's GitHub username. The collaborator will receive an email from GitHub with an invitation to the repository.
5. After accepting the invitation from GitHub, the project will appear under the `Shared Projects` tab in the collaborator's AVAnnotate dashboard.
6. For other types of collaborations and permissions, please see [Managing GitHub Collaborators](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/gh-collab/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
