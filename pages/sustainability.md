# Sustainability

AVAnnotate projects can be downloaded and served as [Offline Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/). All of the data is contained in the downloaded folders.  With the offline download, AVAnnotate and GitHub are not needed to view project sites. All the project files are static HTML files that can be run using a browser on any web server, including one thatâ€™s on a local machine.  An internet connection is not necessary for the project players and index to work if the audio and video represented are also available offine.
