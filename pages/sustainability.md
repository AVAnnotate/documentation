# Sustainability

AVAnnotate projects can be downloaded and served as [Offline Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/). All project data is contained in the downloaded folders.  With the offline download, AVAnnotate and GitHub are not needed to view project sites. All the project files are static HTML files that can run using a browser on any web server, including one that’s on a local machine.  An internet connection is not required for the project players and index to function if the audio and video content is also available offline. 

For more on sustainability, see the [Sustainability](https://avannotate.github.io/guidelines/pages/sustainability.html) section of the AVAnnotate User Guidelines and Resources.
