# Customizing Pages 

Project authors can select to [Auto-Generate Event Pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto-event/) or to build custom pages as part of their projects. Custom pages can also be used for the home page; event pages, or other pages with text; AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links). While AVAnnotate can auto-generate the structure of a page to include a media player for AV events and associated annotations, what appears on customized pages is entirely up to the user.

### Create a custom author-generated page by clicking on the “Add” button in the project dashboard
Custom author-generated pages may include context about the project's events and clips, but can also comprise events and/or event clips.

### Custom text editor layout options
Once the page is added, authors can add a title and text; assign a parent page; and customize the text on the page via the rich text editor.

### Project authors can also customize page layout on custom pages
Insert page layout options including columns, horizontal separators, and single or comparison events (full or clips).
