## Pages

Researchers can select to Auto-Generate Pages or to build Custom Pages as part of their projects. [Auto-Generated Pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/AutogeneratedPages/) may include a home page with a table of contents or an event page with a media player, annotations, and a description. [Custom pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/UserBuiltPages/) can also be used for the home page; event pages, or other pages with text; AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links).

What appears on customized pages is entirely up to the user. While AVAnnotate auto-generates the structure of a page to include a media player for AV events and associated annotations (see ), users may also choose to...
- Add a page that includes an introduction or conclusion to the project;
- Build separate sections of an accompanying analytical essay;
- Add context or pedagogical implications for events and annotations;
- Explain the annotation choices made in the project;
- List project contributors; etc.
