## Pages

What appears on customized pages is entirely up to the user; users may add a page that includes an introduction or conclusion to the project; build separate sections of an accompanying analytical essay; add context or pedagogical implications for events and annotations; explain the annotation choices made in the project; list contributors; etc.

Users can create customized pages for AV files, events, and clips that include text, whole events, or AV clips with or without associated annotations, event or AV clip comparisons, and images (via URL links).
