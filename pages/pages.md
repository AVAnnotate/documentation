## Pages

Project authors can select to Auto-Generate Pages or to build Custom Pages as part of their projects. [Auto-Generated Pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) may include a home page with a table of contents or an event page with a media player, annotations, and a description. [Custom pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom) can also be used for the home page; event pages, or other pages with text; AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links). While AVAnnotate can auto-generate the structure of a page to include a media player for AV events and associated annotations, what appears on customized pages is entirely up to the user.
