## Pages

What appears on customized pages is entirely up to the user. While AVAnnotate auto-generates the structure of a page to include a media player for AV events and associated annotations (see (Auto-Generated Pages)[https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/AutogeneratedPages/]), users may also choose to...
- Add a page that includes an introduction or conclusion to the project;
- Build separate sections of an accompanying analytical essay;
- Add context or pedagogical implications for events and annotations;
- Explain the annotation choices made in the project;
- List project contributors; etc.

Users can create customized pages (see (User-Built Pages)[https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/UserBuiltPages/]) for AV files, events, and clips that include text, entire events, or AV clips with or without associated annotations, event or AV clip comparisons, and images (via URL links).
