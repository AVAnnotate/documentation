# Tags
Tags are labels used in a published AVAnnotate project to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Categories can be used to organize the tags in groups.
- Event pages have tag filtering for annotations.
- Index pages show where tags appear in different Events and AV files. Users can select individual tags for play-back across the project.

## Tags Management System
The AVAnnotate TMS can be used to:
- Upload [Tag Spreadsheets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) and create project-level tags and categories. Tag spreadsheets should be imported before annotation spreadsheets that have tags; when annotation spreadsheets containing tags are imported, they are matched to the tags.
- Modify and delete individual tags and categories. Once modified, tags and categories will change across all annotations.

## Creating Tags
Check and double check tags! Tags should only be comprised of URL safe characters and commas, including commas and the following characters with and without accents:

```
a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```

> **Important Note:** DO NOT DELETE “Uncategorized” tag category.
