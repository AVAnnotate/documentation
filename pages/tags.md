# Tags
In AVAnnotate, tags function like they do in other web applications; tags are labels used in a published AVAnnotate project to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Tags will always belong to a tag group, even if that group is not given a title in AVAnnotate (i.e., these tags will be automatically labeled "Uncategorized" unless designated). Tags and their categories can be accessed in AVAnnotate in two places:
1. Event pages: tags associated with an event's annotations can be viewed and used to filter annotations.
2. Index pages: tags appear as they are associated with different Events and AV files. Individual tags can be selected for play-back across all events in a project.

{: .warning }
> *Check and double check all project tags!* Tags should only be comprised of URL-safe characters (Alphanumeric [0-9a-zA-Z], special characters $-_.+!*'(),), including commas and the following characters with and without accents:

```
a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```

## Uploading Tags and Tag Groups
Sets of tags and tag groups can be uploaded via spreadsheet. See [Spreadsheet Templates and Examples](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/#annotation-spreadsheet-template).


> **Important Note:** DO NOT DELETE “Uncategorized” tag category.

## Managing Tags
To manage tags in AVAnnotate:
- Upload [Tag Spreadsheets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) and create project-level tags and tag groups. Tag spreadsheets should be imported before annotation spreadsheets that have tags; when annotation spreadsheets containing tags are imported, they are matched to the tags.
- Modify and delete individual tags and tag groups. Once modified, tags and groups will change across all annotations.
