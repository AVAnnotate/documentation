# Tags
In AVAnnotate, tags function as they do in other web applications. Tags are labels used in a published AVAnnotate project to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Tags will always belong to a tag group, even if that group is not given a title in AVAnnotate (i.e., these tags will be automatically labeled as "Uncategorized" unless designated otherwise). 

{: .warning }
> Tags should ONLY be comprised of URL-safe characters such as alphanumeric [a-z A-Z] characters with and without accents. Diacritics, commas, and numbers [0-9] are allowed, but no periods (.), apostrophes ('), quotation marks ("), ampersands (&), or other non-alphanumeric characters.

Tags and their categories can be accessed in AVAnnotate in two places:
1. Event pages: tags associated with an event's annotations can be viewed and used to filter annotations.

2. Index pages: tags appear as they are associated with different Events and AV files. Individual tags can be selected for playback across all events in a project.

## Uploading Tags and Tag Groups
Sets of tags and tag groups can be uploaded via a spreadsheet. See [Spreadsheet Templates and Examples](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/#tag-spreadsheet-template).

> DO NOT DELETE “Uncategorized” tag category.

## Managing Tags
To manage tags in AVAnnotate:
- Upload [Tag Spreadsheets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) and create project-level tags and tag groups. Tag spreadsheets should be imported before annotation spreadsheets that have tags; when annotation spreadsheets containing tags are imported, they are matched to the tags.
- Modify and delete individual tags and tag groups. Once modified, tags and groups will change across all annotations.
