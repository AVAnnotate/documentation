# Tags
Tags are labels used in a published AVAnnotate project to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Tag groups can be used to organize or categorize the tags according to the project's goals.
- Event pages have tag filtering for annotations.
- Index pages show where tags appear in different Events and AV files. Users can select individual tags for play-back across the project.

## Tags Management System
The AVAnnotate TMS can be used to:
- Upload [Tag Spreadsheets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) and create project-level tags and tag groups. Tag spreadsheets should be imported before annotation spreadsheets that have tags; when annotation spreadsheets containing tags are imported, they are matched to the tags.
- Modify and delete individual tags and tag groups. Once modified, tags and groups will change across all annotations.

## Creating Tags
*Check and double check all project tags!* Tags should only be comprised of URL-safe characters, including commas and the following characters with and without accents:

```
a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```
