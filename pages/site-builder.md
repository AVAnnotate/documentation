# Site Builder

The `Site Builder` page is where pages are added, edited, and organized for a project. Pages may be created as [Auto-generated pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) or [Custom pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/). Projects are also published from the `Site Builder` as a `GitHub Pages Site` or a `Static Site` (see [here](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/) for more information about offline projects).
