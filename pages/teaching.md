## Teaching Examples
There are many ways to set up how students use AVAnnotate in class. Here are some sample methods and example projects: 

1. Students create an anthology
    1. The instructor and each student will need their own GitHub account.
    2. The instructor creates a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) for the class. 
    3. The instructor [adds each student](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/adding-people-to-your-organization) as a member to the class GitHub organization using each student's GitHub ID. Note: the instructor can choose a "role" for each student in the GitHub organization. If the instructor wants each student to have automatic editing access to other student's project, select `Owner.` In the `Member` role, students will be able to see other student's projects through the AVAnnotate dashboard but will not be able to edit. Go to [Add users]() 
    4. Each student creates their own project using the class organization when they [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/).
