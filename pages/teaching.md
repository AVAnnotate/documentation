## Teaching Examples
There are many ways to set up how students use AVAnnotate in class. Here are some sample methods and example projects: 

1. Students create an anthology
    1. The instructor creates a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) for the class. 
    2. Each student will need their own GitHub account. Using their GitHub ID, the instructor adds each student as a member with "write" permissions to the class organization.
    3. Each student creates their own project using the class organization when they [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/).
