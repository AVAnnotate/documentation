# Data Manager
The AVAnnotate application interface is split into several primary sections: “Data Manager” and “Site Builder.” 

In the Data Manager, a project author can import, upload, and add all of the data associated with Events, Tags, and Annotations. The Data Manager contains two subsections: Events and Tags.

**Events** tab allows users to create Events, which may contain media files and tagged annotations. The **Tags** tab allows users to upload, create, or edit project-wide tags and tag groups. This section contains how-to's for each element within the Data Manager, including adding and editing Events; creating Annotations; and working with the Tags management system.
