# Data Manager
The AVAnnotate application interface is split into two primary sections: Data Manager and [Site Builder](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/site-builder/). 

In the Data Manager, a project author can import, upload, and add all of the data associated with [Events](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/), [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/), and [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/).

The Data Manager contains two tabs: 

**Events** tab allows users to create `Events`, which may contain media files and time-stamped annotations.

**Tags** tab allows users to upload, create, or edit project-wide tags and tag groups. This section contains how-to's for each element within the Data Manager, including adding and editing Events; creating Annotations; and working with the Tags management system.
