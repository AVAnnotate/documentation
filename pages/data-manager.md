# Data Manager
The AVAnnotate application interface is split into several primary sections: “Data Manager” and “Site Builder.” 

In the Data Manager, a project author can import, upload, and add all of the data associated with Events, Tags, and Annotations. The Data Manager contains two subsections: Events and Tags. The **Events** tab allows users to create Events, which may contain media files and tagged annotations. The Tags tab allows users to upload, create, or edit project-wide tags and tag groups.
