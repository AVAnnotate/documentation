# Data Manager
The AVAnnotate application interface is split into two primary sections: [Data Manager](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/data-manager/) and [Site Builder](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/site-builder/).

In the [Data Manager](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/data-manager/) section, a project author can import, upload, edit, and add all of the data associated with [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/), [Events](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/), and [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/).

The Data Manager section contains two tabs: 
1) The [Events](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) tab allows users to create `Events`, which may contain media files and time-stamped annotations.

2) The [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) tab allows users to upload, create, or edit project-wide `tags` and tag groups.
