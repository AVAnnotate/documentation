# Managing GitHub Collaborators
All members of a GitHub organization or GitHub repository will have access in the AVAnnotate dashboard to any AVAnnotate project created in that repository. If a user is a "Member" of a GitHub organization or GitHub repository, they will have viewing access through the AVAnnotate dashboard to that project. If a user is an "Owner" of a GitHub organization or repository, they will be able to edit the project in the dashboard of AVAnnotate, but they will not be able to edit the project. 
1. Adding or deleting a collaborator to an AVAnnotate GitHub repository: Use the AVAnnotate dashboard to [Add and delete AVAnnotate Collaborators](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/add-collab/) or to [Invite Personal Collaborators through GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
2. Creating Collaborations through GitHub Organizations: [Creating a new GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) is a method for  allowing teams or classes to build projects together in the same collection of repositories. Members who are "Owners" in that organization will all have editing access to any AVAnnotate repositories created in that organization
