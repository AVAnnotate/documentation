# Managing GitHub Collaborators
All members of a GitHub organization or GitHub repository will have access to an AVAnnotate project that has been created in that repository. If a user has editing permissions through GitHub to an organization or repository, usually as "Owner," they will have editing access through the AVAnnotate dashboard to that project. If a user is a simply a "Member" of a GitHub repository, they will be able to see the project in the dashboard of AVAnnotate, but they will not be able to edit the project. 
1. Adding or delete a collaborator to an AVAnnotate GitHub repository: Use the AVAnnotate dashboard to [Add and delete AVAnnotate Collaborators](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/add-collab/) or by [Inviting Personal Collaborators through GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
2. Creating collaborations through GitHub Organizations: create a new project by selecting that organization or create a new GitHub organization. Members with the appropriate permissions in that organization will all have access to any AVAnnotate repositories created in that organization through the Shared Projects tab on the AVAnnotate dashboard.
5. Changing existing permmissions: Please visit (Managing Teams and People with Access to Your Repository)[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository] to learn more about changing existing permissions.
