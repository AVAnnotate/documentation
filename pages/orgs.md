# Creating and Accessing GitHub Accounts and Organizations
[GitHub organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) "are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once, with sophisticated security and administrative features." For AVAnnotate projects, a class could be an "organization" or a research team or library might have a shared GitHub account. 

There are three steps to using new accounts and organizations in an AVAnnotate project:
1. [Create a new GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
2. [Give AVAnnotate permission to access the organization](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/Ov23liBba1hgUZ9JMEoo).
3. AVAnnotate users will need to re-Login to the AVAnnotate in order to see the new organization or account in the AVAnnotate Dashboard.
