# Privacy Statement

AVAnnotate does not store or keep user data; instead, AVAnnotate acts as an intermediary between project authors and the normal functionality of GitHub. In other words, when a GitHub user authorizes the AVAnnotate app, they are not in anyway changing the privacy or security of a repository, or any other repositories within a GitHub organization; 
private repositories will still be private and can only be viewed by users authorized in GitHub. 

It is easiest to think about AVAnnotate as simply being an alternate interface to GitHub, meaning that nothing that is done in the AVAnnotate app could not also be done via the GitHub web interface. Logging into AVAnnotate will require users to "Sign in with GitHub," which is just authorizing the AVAnnotate application to do what the user
could do manually in GitHub.
