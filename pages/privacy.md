# Privacy and Permissions Statement

AVAnnotate does not store or keep user data; instead, AVAnnotate acts as an intermediary between project authors and the normal functionality of GitHub. It is easiest to think about AVAnnotate as simply being an alternate interface to GitHub, meaning that nothing that is done in the AVAnnotate app could not also be done via the GitHub web interface. Logging into AVAnnotate will require users to "Sign in with GitHub," which is just authorizing the AVAnnotate application to do what the user could do manually in GitHub.

When a GitHub user authorizes the AVAnnotate app, they are not in anyway changing the privacy or security of a repository, or any other repositories within a GitHub organization; private repositories will still be private and can only be viewed by users authorized in GitHub. For more information on making private repositories, see [Private projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/private/).

AVAnnotate stakeholders who are concerned with giving permissions to AVAnnotate may create a separate GitHub user account to create repositories that are separate from the repositories of concern. Building on Github means AVAnnotate is tied to its benefits -- free storage & publication, reasonably stable long term support -- and its detriments, including limitations to their security model & API.
