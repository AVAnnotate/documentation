# Privacy and Permissions Statement

AVAnnotate does not store or retain user data; instead, it functions as an intermediary between project authors and GitHub's standard features.  Logging into AVAnnotate requires users to “Sign in with GitHub,” which simply authorizes the AVAnnotate app to perform actions the user could manually do on GitHub. It's easiest to think of AVAnnotate as just another interface for GitHub, meaning that anything done in AVAnnotate could also be done directly through the GitHub web interface.

Private repositories will still remain private and can only be viewed by users authorized in GitHub. For more information on making private repositories, see [Private projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/private/).

Building on GitHub means AVAnnotate benefits from free storage and publication, as well as reasonably stable long-term support; however, it also faces drawbacks, including the limitations imposed by how GitHub creates access to its API. AVAnnotate stakeholders concerned with granting permissions to AVAnnotate might create a separate GitHub user account to manage repositories that are distinct from the repositories of concern.
