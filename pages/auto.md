# Creating Auto-Generated Pages 
AVAnnotate will create auto-generated pages for a project when selected on [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/). The auto-generated pages will include a generated Home Page with a generated Table of Contents, a page for each Event created, an index with any created [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/), and  a navigation menu. 

### Auto-generate event page
Auto-generated pages can also be created for each Event when selected on the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page. If an Event has an auto-generated page, the published Event page will include a media player, annotations, and a description.

Once the user uploads annotations for an event, they will display next to (video) or under (audio) the media player.

On the [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) edit page, "auto-generate web page" is toggled on by default, but can be disabled at any point in the Event settings.

<br><br>

On the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-Generated - Home” (to indicate the project home page) or “Auto-Generated - Event” (to indicate an event page).<br>
