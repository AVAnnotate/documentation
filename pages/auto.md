# Creating and Disabling Auto-Generated Pages 
Auto-generated pages are selected on the [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page and the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page. When auto-generated pages are selected in `Event,` AVAnnotate will generate a home page with a table of contents. If an 'Event' has an auto-generated page, the published event page will include a media player, annotations, and a description. Auto-generated pages appear in the generated Table of Contents and navigation menu. 

### Authors can toggle "auto-generate web page" on/off on "Add Event" page
When adding an Event, "auto-generate web page" is toggled on by default, but can be disabled at any point in the Event settings.

### Home and Event auto-generated pages in the dashboard
On the dashboard for a project, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-Generated - Home” (to indicate the project home page) or “Auto-Generated - Event” (to indicate an event page).<br>

### Pages will be designated "Auto-Generated-Event" or "Auto-Generated-Home" until the project's author disables auto-generation in order to customize the page
Disable auto-generated home and event pages by selecting the three-dot menu and clicking "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a [custom page](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/).

### The most basic auto-generated event page contains 1) a title (and optional description), and 2) a media player to display the A/V event that has been uploaded to the project
Auto-generated Event pages by default feature a media player alongside space for the project author’s user-generated annotations.

### Layout for an auto-generated Event page with imported annotations.
Once the user uploads annotations for an event, they will display next to (video) or under (audio) the media player.
