# Create a Project
Users can create auto-generated pages for `Events` when selected on [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/).

Auto-generated project pages include a generated Home Page with Table of Contents, a page for each Event created, an index with any created [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/), and a navigation menu. If an `Event` has an auto-generated page, the published `Event` page will include a media player, annotations, and a description. 


On the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-Generated - Home” (to indicate the project home page) or “Auto-Generated - Event” (to indicate an event page).<br>

# Add an Event
Auto-generated pages can also be created for each `Event` when selected on the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page.

On the [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) edit page, "auto-generate web page" is toggled on by default, but can be disabled at any point in the Event settings.
