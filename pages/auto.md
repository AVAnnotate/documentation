# Creating and Disabling Auto-generated Pages 
Auto-generated pages are selected on the [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page and the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page. When auto-generated pages are selected in `Event,` AVAnnotate will generate a home page with a table of contents. If an 'Event' has an auto-generated page, the published event page will include a media player, annotations, and a description. Auto-generated pages appear in the generated Table of Contents and navigation menu. 

## When adding an Event, "auto-generate web page" is toggled on by default, but can be disabled at any point in the Event settings.

## On the dashboard for a project, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-Generated - Home” (to indicate the project home page) or “Auto-Generated - Event” (to indicate an event page).<br>

## Disable auto-generated home and event pages by selecting the three-dot menu and clicking "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a [custom page](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/).<br>

## Auto-generated Event pages by default feature a media player alongside space for the project author’s user-generated annotations.<br>

<br>

## Once the user uploads annotations for an event, they will display next to (video) or under (audio) the media player.<br>
