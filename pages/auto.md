# Auto-Generated Pages
Auto-generated pages can be created for each `Event` on the [Site Builder](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/site-builder/) page by hitting the `Add Page` button and selecting `Auto-generated page`.

Auto-generated project pages feature a Home Page with a Table of Contents, a page for each created [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/), an index of [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/), and a navigation menu. If an `Event` has an auto-generated page, the published `Event` page will include annotations, the event description, and a media player. 

On the [Site Builder](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/site-builder/) page, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-generated."

On the [Site Builder](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/site-builder/) page, you can "Disable" or "Re-Enable" auto-generation at any point in the settings of an `Event`.
