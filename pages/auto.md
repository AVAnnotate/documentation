# Creating and Disabling Auto-generated Pages 
Auto-generated pages are selected on the [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page and the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page. When auto-generated pages are selected in `Event,` AVAnnotate will generate a home page with a table of contents. If an 'Event' has an auto-generated page, the published event page will include a media player, annotations, and a description. Auto-generated pages appear in the generated Table of Contents and navigation menu.
