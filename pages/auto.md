# Creating and Disabling Auto-Generated Pages 
AVAnnotate will create auto-generated pages for a project when selected on [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/). The auto-generated pages will include a generated Home Page with a generated Table of Contents, a page for each Event created, an index with any created [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/), and  a navigation menu. 

### Auto-generate event page
Auto-generated pages can also be created for each Event when selected on the [Add an Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) page. If an Event has an auto-generated page, the published Event page will include a media player, annotations, and a description.

Once the user uploads annotations for an event, they will display next to (video) or under (audio) the media player.

On the [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) edit page, "auto-generate web page" is toggled on by default, but can be disabled at any point in the Event settings.

<br><br>

On the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, auto-generated pages are marked as “Auto-Generated - Home” (to indicate the project home page) or “Auto-Generated - Event” (to indicate an event page).<br>

### Disable auto-generation
Disable auto-generated home and event pages by navigating to the `Pages` tab on the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, selecting the three-dot menu next to the event, and choosing "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a [custom page](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/). Select  "Re-enable Auto-Generation" to recreate the auto-generated page. The custom page will not be lost. It will reappear when "Disable Auto-Generation" is selected again for that event.
