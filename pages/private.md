# Private projects 

Private projects are GitHub repositories that are only accessible to the owner and people who are explicitly invited to have access. Up to three collaborators can be given access to GitHub private repositories.

1. To create a private AVAnnotate project, navigate to the `Project Settings` gear icon. Toggle on “Use Private Repository,” which will automatically toggle off “Generate GitHub Pages.

2. When the project builds, online public pages will not be built. To see the built project offline in a browser or a local server, follow the instructions in [Offline](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/) projects.
