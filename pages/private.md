# Private projects 

Private projects are GitHub repositories accessible only to the owner and those who are explicitly invited. Up to three collaborators can have access to GitHub private repositories.

To create a private AVAnnotate project, navigate to the `Project Settings` under the three-dot menu.

Toggle on “Private Repository,” which will prevent the generation of GitHub pages.

When the project is built, online public pages will not be created. To view the built project offline in a browser or on a local server, follow the instructions in the [Offline](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/) section.
