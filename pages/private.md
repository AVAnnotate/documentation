# Private projects 

Private projects can be created with up to three collaborators using GitHub private repositories.

1. To create a private AVAnnotate project, navigate to Project Settings, toggle on “Use Private Repository,” which will automatically toggle off off “Generate GitHub Pages.

2. When the project builds, online public pages will not be built. To see the built project offline in a browser or a local server, follow the instructions in [Offline](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/offline/) projects.
