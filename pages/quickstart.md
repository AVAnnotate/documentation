# Quick Start: How to Use AVAnnotate

## Step 1: Log into AVAnnotate with your GitHub Credentials

Sign in with your GitHub credentials, or create a new [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} account by providing a username, email address, and password.

## Step 2: Create a New Project

Select `+ Add` on the `Projects` page and input information about the new project, including the `GitHub Account` associated with the project, `Title`, `Description`, `Language`, and `Project Slug`. `Project Contributor(s)` and `Collaborators` are optional. For more information, see [Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/projects/). 

## Step 3: Add an Event

Most `Events` are associated with a single AV file, but an event may be associated with multiple AV files if it required more than one tape or reel to record it. Alternatively, in special cases, there is no AV file. See [here](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) for more information on `Events`.

Select `+ Create` under the `+ Add` menu on the `Data Manager` page and input information about the new event, including the event `Label.` For the AV file, include `AV Type` (Audio or Video), `Label`, `URL`, and `Duration.` `Description`, `Citation`, and `Rights Statement` are optional fields. AVAnnotate can reference AV and images through [URLs](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/av/) or [IIIF manifests](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/iiif/). `Events` can also be imported via `Import` under the `+ Add` menu on the `Data Manager` page. See [here](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) for more on importing events.

> AVAnnotate does not store AV or image files.

## Step 4: Add annotations and timestamps

`Annotations` and `Timestamps` are user-created and correspond to a point or range in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the audio and video that might include a transcript; captions; information about formal features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises such as fans or car horns; or information about conceptual notes or themes. For more information, see [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/).

## Step 5: Add tags and tag groups

`Tags` are labels or index terms used in the published project to organize and discover topics in the annotations. `Tag groups` are used to organize the tags. For more information, see [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/).

## Step 6: Customize pages to build context

Users can create [auto-generated pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) for each event as well as design [custom pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/) that include text, whole events, AV clips with or without associated annotations,  AV clip comparisons, and images (via URL links). Users might add a page that includes an introduction or conclusion to the project; build separate sections of an accompanying analytical essay; add context or pedagogical implications for events and annotations; explain the annotation choices made in the project; etc. For more information, see [Pages](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/pages/).

## Step 7: Publish and share your AVAnnotate project with the world!

Go to the `Site Builder` page and select `Publish`!
