# Quick Start: How to Use AVAnnotate

## Helpful tips before getting started:
1. AVAnnotate does not import AV files. Collect AV URLs or manifests before starting projects. See ?? for list of supported AV URL types.
2. While you can edit in AVAnnotate, we recommend that you create spreadsheets for events, tags, and annotations. See templates.   
3. GitHub is slow. If you are making many changes at once, turn off Generate Pages in the Project settings page and toggle it back on when you are ready for the application to build your online project pages. 
4. The application assumes an order of tasks: if you have tags, upload them first before uploading any annotations with those tags. Tags take a long time to update on the backend.
5. Check and double check your tags! Tags can only have certain characters. See??
6. If you get a blank page when publishing and viewing a project, refresh the page. 
7. If you are creating projects without associated media (i.e., no URLs): upload event spreadsheet  leaving the URL column blank. (individually labeling as Offline disables the player for events without media/URL)
8. Keep “Projects” tab open/open individual projects in new windows to avoid waiting for “Loading your projects” screen


## Step 1: Log into AVAnnotate with your GitHub credentials and create a new project

Navigate to the [AVAnnotate application](https://avannotate.netlify.app/) and sign in with your GitHub credentials, or create a new [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account by providing a username, email address, and password.

Select “Add,” and input information about the new project, including the project title, description, language, a URL “slug,” and collaborators.

## Step 2: Add an Event

An “Event” in AVAnnotate can comprise single or multiple AV files and single or multiple sets of annotations. AVAnnotate will create or ingest a [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/) for each event. Event pages can be auto-generated or created by the user.

Select “Add,” and input information about the new event, including the event label; item type (audio or video); AV label, URL, and duration; description; and citation.

## Step 3: Add tags
Tags are labels used in the interface to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Categories can be used to organize the tags in groups.

## Step 4: Add annotations

Annotations are added to each event. Annotations are user-created and correspond to a given timestamp point or range in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the media that might include a transcript; captions; information about formal features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises such as fans or car horns; or conceptual notes or themes. Annotations often include tags for indexing.  

## Step 5: Add pages to build context around the project's events.

Users can create auto-generated pages for each event as well as design custom pages that include text, events or event clips with or without associated annotations, event or event clip comparisons, and images (that are available via URL). What appears on these pages is entirely up to the user; users may add an introduction or conclusion to the project; build separate sections of an accompanying analytical essay; add context or pedagogical implications of events and annotations; explain the annotation choices made in the project; etc.

## Step 6: Share your AVAnnotate project with the world!
