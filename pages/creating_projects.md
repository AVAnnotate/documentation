### Select `+ Add` and input information about the new project, including:
- `GitHub Organization` Projects can be saved in any organization in which a user has write permissions in GitHub. See more at [GitHub Accounts and Organizations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/orgs/). 
- `Use Private Repository` Projects can be kept private. See more at [Private Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/private/). 
- `Generate GitHub Pages Site` If checked, a static site will be created in the project repository and viewable online.
- `Title` The title of the project will appear in the header on the site. 
- `Description` The description will appear on the front page of the auto-generated site. 
- `Language`
- `Project Slug` Slugs appear in the project URL. Slugs should be lower case without spaces or punctuation other than a dash `-`.
- `Project Authors` Authors will appear in the footer of the site. 
- `Collaborators` Collaborators are added with GitHub usernames that can be auto-completed via AVAnnotate. Added collaborators will have access to editing the project under the `Shared Projects` tab in the AVAnnotate dashboard.
