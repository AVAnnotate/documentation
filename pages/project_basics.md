# Project Basics

Below is a brief list of guiding questions for users interested in creating an AVAnnotate project. For more guidance on how to plan for projects as a researcher, teacher, or collecting professional, please see [AVAnnotate User Guidelines and Resources
](https://avannotate.github.io/guidelines/).

**Audience**: Who is your audience? What are they interested in? What worries or matters to them?

**Material**: What is your material? Where is your material located? Do you have public access? How many AV events and items are you planning to include? How might these events and items relate to each other? Do you want to include images?

**Process**: Do you have collaborators? Do you have outside resources you want to consider, such as scholarship or protocols?

**Argument**: What do you want your audience to know about these materials? How would you like them to receive this information? By simply providing the media or by adding annotations, indexed terms, essays, or images?
