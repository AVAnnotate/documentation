## Project Basics

Below is a short list of of some guiding questions for users interested in building an AVAnnotate project. The sub-pages of this section each provide further detail on the components of an AVAnnotate project that should be considered alongside each of these questions.

**Audience**: Who is your audience? What do they care about? What are their interests and concerns?  

**Material**: What is your material? Where is your material? Do you have public access? How many AV events and items are you planning to include? How might these events and items correspond to one another? Do you want to include images?

**Process**: Do you have collaborators? Do you have outside resources you want to consider such as scholarship or protocols?

**Argument**: What do you want your audience to know about these materials? How do you want them to know this information? By simply providing the media or by adding annotations, indexed terms, essays, or images?
