# Deleting and Transfering Owndership Projects
Every AVAnnotate project corresponds to a repository in the user's GitHub account. Deleting and transfering ownership to projects is accomplished by deleting and transfering ownership to GitHub repositories. These actions are GitHub actions that cannot be completed through the AVAnnotate dashboard. They must be completed through the projects's settings on the GitHub repository. To find the project's GitHub repository, go to the user's GitHub account at https://github.com/[username], navigate to `Repositories`, select the repository and navigate to `Settings`. Further information can be found on the GitHub documentation:

2. [Deleting a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository).
