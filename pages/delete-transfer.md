# Transfering Ownership and Deleting Projects
Every AVAnnotate project corresponds to a repository in the user's GitHub account. Deleting and transfering ownership to projects is accomplished by deleting and transfering ownership to GitHub repositories. These actions are GitHub actions that cannot be completed through the AVAnnotate dashboard. They must be completed through the project's settings on the project's GitHub repository. To find the project's GitHub repository, go to the user's GitHub account at https://github.com/[username], navigate to `Repositories`, select the project repository and navigate to `Settings`.
