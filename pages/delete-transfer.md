# Transferring Ownership and Deleting Projects
Each AVAnnotate project corresponds to a repository in the project author's GitHub account. Deleting or transferring ownership of projects involves deleting or transferring ownership of the corresponding GitHub repositories. 

These actions are performed in the project’s settings on the GitHub repository itself and **cannot** be done through the AVAnnotate dashboard.

## Locating the GitHub repository 
Select the three-dot menu for the project setting in the AVAnnotate dashboard and select "Repository."

## Locating settings in the GitHub repository
In GitHub, navigate to `Settings` at the top of the repository page. Transferring or deleting a repository can be done in the `Danger Zone` section at the bottom of the `Settings` page for the project.
