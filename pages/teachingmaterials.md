## Teaching Materials

There are many ways to set up how students use AVAnnotate in class. Here are some sample methods and example projects:

Students create an anthology
- The instructor and each student will need their own GitHub account.
- The instructor creates a GitHub Organization for the class.
- The instructor adds each student as a member to the class GitHub organization using each student’s GitHub ID. Note: the instructor can choose a “role” for each student in the GitHub organization. If the instructor wants each student to have automatic editing access to other student’s project, select Owner. In the Member role, students will be able to see other student’s projects through the AVAnnotate dashboard but will not be able to edit. Go to Add users
- Each student creates their own project using the class organization when they Add a Project.
