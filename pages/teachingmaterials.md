# Teaching Materials

There are many ways to use AVAnnotate in classrooms across disciplines and student rank, as AVAnnotate is a flexible and versatile tool for teaching skills related to multimodal analysis. The AVAnnotate team and project partners have implemented AVAnnotate in many undergraduate and graduate classes at the University of Texas at Austin and beyond. Write ups of several case studies can be found [in this "Teaching with AVAnnotate" resource packet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyh5GOH26CGubcBqDr4Cy_Q68cB96OFMv_IZrQ-b0cg/edit?usp=sharing). 

The resource packet linked above contains much of the information teachers may need to implement AVAnnotate in their own courses, including: 
   - Course descriptions
   - Course learning objectives
   - Assignment descriptions and deadlines 
   - Semester calendars (weekly/daily agendas; module and unit breakdown)
   - Lesson plans
   - In-person classroom materials 
   - Annotation peer review guidelines
   - Sample student projects

The AVAnnotate team is always happy to support teachers seeking to teach with AVAnnotate, and offers in-person and virtual walk-throughs for students and instructors; workshopping; and technical support. 

## Presenting Student Projects
A popular deliverable of incorporating AVAnnotate in the classroom has been class-wide anthologies of student projects. The directions below explain how a class might create a shared anthology, like [the RHE 306 Anthology](https://trentwintermeier.github.io/rhe-306-anthology/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which presents all of the projects students individually created in a First-Year Composition class in the Spring 2025 semester. 

## Instructions for creating a class anthology:
1. Connect via GitHub.
   - The instructor and each student will need to individually create their own GitHub account.
   - The instructor creates a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the class.
2. The instructor [adds each student](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/adding-people-to-your-organization){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a member to the class GitHub organization using each student's GitHub username.
    - Note: the instructor can control students' editing permissions by designating a "role" for each student in the GitHub organization. If the instructor wants each       student to have automatic editing access to all other students' project, select `Owner.` In the `Member` role, students will be able to view other student's projects through the AVAnnotate dashboard but will not be able to edit.
3. Each student creates their own project as part of the the class organization when they [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/).
