## Helpful tips before getting started
- Logging into [AVAnnotate](https://avannotate.netlify.app/) requires a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).<br>
- AVAnnotate does not import AV files. Collect AV and image URLs or manifests before starting projects. See [AV Formats and Support](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/av/) for a list of supported AV URL types.<br>
- Editing Events, Tags, and Annotations in the AVAnnotate dashboard is possible, but it is highly recommended to create spreadsheets for events, tags, and annotations using spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) then uploading and auto-generating projects before customizing. See [Spreadsheet Templates](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) for spreadsheet templates, documentation, and examples. <br>
- GitHub *can be slow* and generating web pages *can take time* and *be finicky*. If uploading many annotation sets at once, it is recommended to upload one set at a time, build the project pages, and assess if the page build has been successful before uploading more annotation sets. Once it is determined that tags and annotation pages are building successfully, users might toggle off 'Auto Generate Pages' under a project's 'Settings' before making multiple changes and toggling it back on when ready for the application to build online project pages. See [Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/projects/) for more information. <br>
- [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) are at the heart of any AVAnnotate project as they are a very powerful way for users to discover annotations. Tags should be clear, succinct, organized, and double-checked for typos and capitalization errors before introducing them in a project. Ideally tags and tag groups are uploaded before uploading any annotations with those tags.<br>
