# Creating and Modifying Annotation Sets
AVAnnotate allows users to organize their annotations for AV files via different "sets" such as one set for Transcripts and another for Notes or one annotation set in English and another in Spanish. 
- Annotations can be added to the 'Default' set or to a newly created set through `Event` settings. The 'Default' set can be renamed but cannot be deleted.
- Annotation sets can be added manually, via a IIIF manifest, or imported via a separate spreadsheet or .VTT file (Web Video Text Track file).
- Annotation sets can be set as captions on a video file (note: this does not work for YouTube, which has its own captioning system) by selecting the settings of an annotation set in the `Event` settings.
