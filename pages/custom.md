# Creating custom pages 
Pages can be created for the home page, for contextual essay pages, for custom-designed event pages, for pages that include AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images. 
 
## Add a custom page
From the Site Builder tab, <br><br>

### Custom text editor layout options
Once the page is added, authors can add a title and text; assign a parent page; and customize the text on the page via the rich text editor.

### Project authors can also customize page layout on custom pages
Insert page layout options including columns, horizontal separators, and single or comparison events (full or clips).

### Disable auto-generation
Disable auto-generated home and event pages by navigating to the `Pages` tab on the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, selecting the three-dot menu next to the event, and choosing "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a custom page. Select  "Re-enable Auto-Generation" to recreate the auto-generated page. The custom page will not be lost. It will reappear when "Disable Auto-Generation" is selected again for that event.
