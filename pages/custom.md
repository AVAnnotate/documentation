## Custom pages can be used for the home page; event pages or other pages with text; AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links).

### Home and Event pages can be customized by disabling [auto-generation](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/). To disable auto-generation on a given Home or Event page, click on the three dots and select “Disable Auto-Generation.” <br>
