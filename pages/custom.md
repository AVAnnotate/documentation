Custom pages can be used for the home page; event pages or other pages with text; AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links).

Home and Event pages can be customized by disabling [auto-generation](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/). To disable auto-generation on a given Home or Event page, click on the three dots and select “Disable Auto-Generation.” Image 1 illustrates how to disable auto-generation on the project dashboard.

Custom author-generated pages may include context about events and clips, but can also comprise events and clips. Create a custom author-generated page by clicking on the “Add” button in the project dashboard.
