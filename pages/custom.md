# Customizing Pages 
Custom pages can be used for the project home page; any pages with or without events; pages home to AV clips with or without associated annotations; AV event or clip comparisons; and images (via URL links).

### Disable [auto-generation](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) on the project dashboard in order to customize pages by disabling
To disable auto-generation on a given Home or Event page, click on the three dots and select “Disable Auto-Generation.”

Once the page is added, authors can add a title and text; assign a parent page; and customize the text on the page via the rich text editor.
