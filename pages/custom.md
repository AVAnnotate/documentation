Once the page is added, add a title and assign a parent page. Customize the text and media on the page via the rich text editor. For details on the customization features, see [Custom Text Editor Options](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/#:~:text=the%20published%20project.-,Custom%20Text%20Editor%20Options,-The%20custom%20rich) below.

# Disabling and Re-enabling Auto-generation
Disable auto-generated home and event pages by navigating to the `Site Builder` tab on the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, selecting the three-dot menu next to the event, and choosing "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a custom page. Select  "Re-enable Auto-Generation" to recreate the auto-generated page. The custom page will not be lost. It will reappear when "Disable Auto-Generation" is selected again for that event.

# Reordering Pages
Pages can be re-ordered using the three-dot settings either on the same level or by making a page a sub-page or a super-page. These changes will appear in the table of contents and side-bar menus of the published project.
