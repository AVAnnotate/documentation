# Creating custom pages 
Pages can be customized for 
- the home page
- event pages
- pages for essays or context pages that might include
  - AV clips with or without associated annotations
  - AV event or clip comparisons
  - images 
 
## Add a custom page
From the Site Builder tab, create a custom page by selecting `Add.`

### Custom text editor layout options
Once the page is added, add a title and text; assign a parent page; and customize the text on the page via the rich text editor.

## Disabling auto-generation
Disable auto-generated home and event pages by navigating to the `Pages` tab on the [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) page, selecting the three-dot menu next to the event, and choosing "Disable Auto-Generation." This will generate an empty page for creating a custom page. Select  "Re-enable Auto-Generation" to recreate the auto-generated page. The custom page will not be lost. It will reappear when "Disable Auto-Generation" is selected again for that event.

## Reordering pages
Pages can be re-ordered using the three-dot settings either on the same level or by making a page a sub-page or a super-page. These changes will appear in the table of contents and side-bar menus of the published project.
