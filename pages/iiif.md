An “Event” in AVAnnotate can comprise single or multiple AV files and single or multiple sets of annotations. AVAnnotate will create or ingest a [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/) for each event. Event pages can be auto-generated or created by the user.

IIIF is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. It’s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions.
Leveraging IIIF and GitHub for sharing curated annotations of audiovisual materials held at libraries, archives, and museums, AVAnnotate allows users to combine metadata for online audio and video assets with user-generated annotations and contextual essays to create simple, playable web-based editions and exhibits.

Many libraries, archives, and museums provide IIIF manifests for digitized audio and video recordings. The Internet Archive is another great resource for finding direct links to audio and video recordings.
