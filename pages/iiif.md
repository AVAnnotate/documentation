# International Image Interoperability Framework

## About IIIF and AVAnnotate 
AVAnnotate integrates [the IIIF standard](https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/) in order to faciliate the production of standards-based, collaborative, and sustainable projects. IIIF is a framework for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. It’s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs and including a consortium of leading cultural institutions. Many libraries, archives, and museums provide IIIF manifests for digitized audio and video recordings. The Internet Archive is another great resource for finding direct links to audio and video recordings.

AVAnnotate will create or ingest a [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for each event. Creating IIIF manifests allows for the metadata associated with an AVAnnotate project (e.g., rights information, audiovisual materials, annotations, etc.) to be easily shared and reproduced. IIIF manifests [may also be imported into a new project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/), allowing for existing annotation, captions, and transcripts to be retained, edited, and (re)presented in AVAnnotate.

> An AVAnnotate project's IIIF manifest can be accessed by selecting the IIIF image in the bottom right corner of the published project. 

### Compatibility
IIIF has native compatibility with the W3C Web Annotation model, which supports annotating content on the Web. However, audiovisual media may not be playable in certain browsers via a IIIF manifest. For example, Safari doesn't have built-in support for DASH format. Google Chrome is the recommended browser for engaging with AV and IIIF compatibility.
