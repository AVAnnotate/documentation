1. AVAnnotate does not import AV files. Collect AV URLs or manifests before starting projects. See (AV Formats and Support)[av.md] for a list of supported AV URL types.
2. Editing details in AVAnnotate is possible, it is highly recommended to create spreadsheets for events, tags, and annotations for bulk uploading and auto-generating projects. See (Spreadsheet Templates)[templates.md].
3. GitHub is slow. If making many changes at one time, toggle off "Auto Generate Pages" on the Project settings page and toggle it back on when you are ready for the application to build your online project pages.
4. The application assumes an order of tasks: if you have tags, upload them first before uploading any annotations with those tags. Tags take a long time to update on the backend.
