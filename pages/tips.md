## Helpful tips before getting started
- Logging into [AVAnnotate](https://avannotate.netlify.app/) requires a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).<br>

- AVAnnotate does not store uploaded media; instead, it references media files via URL. Collect any audio/visual media file paths, manifests, and/or image URLs in a document, and paste them into AVAnnotate. See [AV Formats and Support](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/av/) for a list of supported AV file paths/URL types.<br>

- **IT is highly recommended that project authors create spreadsheets for events, tags, and annotations using spreadsheet software** (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) to upload before customizing a project via the AVAnnotate editing interface. See [Spreadsheet Templates](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) for spreadsheet templates, documentation, and examples. <br>

- GitHub *can be slow* and generating web pages *can take time* and *be finicky*. If uploading many annotation sets to a single project, it is recommended to upload one set at a time, build the associated project page(s), and assess if the page build has been successful before uploading more annotation sets. Once it is determined that tags and annotation pages are building successfully, users might toggle off 'Auto Generate Pages' under a project's 'Settings' before making multiple changes and toggling it back on when ready for the application to build online project pages. See [Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/projects/) for more information. <br>

- [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) are at the heart of any AVAnnotate project as they are a powerful way for users to sort, filter, and discover annotations across an entire project. Tags should be clear, succinct, and triple-checked for typos and capitalization errors before introducing them in a project. Ideally tags and tag groups are uploaded before uploading any annotations with those tags.<br>
