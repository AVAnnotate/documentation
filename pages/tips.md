## Helpful tips before getting started
1. Logging into [AVAnnotate](https://avannotate.netlify.app/) requires a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).<br>
2. AVAnnotate does not import AV files. Collect AV and image URLs or manifests before starting projects. See [AV Formats and Support](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/av/) for a list of supported AV URL types.<br>
3. Editing Events, Tags, and Annotations in the AVAnnotate dashboard is possible, but it is highly recommended to create spreadsheets for events, tags, and annotations using spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) then uploading and auto-generating projects. See [Spreadsheet Templates](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/) for spreadhseet templates, documentation, and examples. <br>
4. GitHub can be slow and generating web pages can take time. If making many changes at once, toggle off "Auto Generate Pages" on the "Project Settings" page. After making changes, toggle "Auto Generate Pages" back on when you are ready for the application to build your online project pages. See [Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/projects/) for more information. <br>
5. [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/)!! are at the heart of any AVAnnotate project as they are a very powerful way for users to discover annotations. Tags should be clear, succinct, organized, and double-checked for typos and capitalization errors before introducing them in a project. Ideally tags and tag categories are uploaded before uploading any annotations with those tags.<br>
