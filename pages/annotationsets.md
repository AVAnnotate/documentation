# Annotation Sets

An annotation set is a group of annotations for a single AV file. In the end-user interface, visitors can filter annotations based on these sets. Annotation sets might be organized to include one for transcripts and another for notes, or one in English and another in Spanish, or one created by Manuel and another by Laura.

## Creating and Modifying Annotation Sets
When annotations are added to an event, AVAnnotate creates a 'Default' annotation set through `Event` settings.

{: .warning }
> The 'Default' annotation set can be renamed, but <em>cannot</em> be deleted. If the user wants to delete the default annotation set (even when it is renamed), they must create a new set. Once annotations are added to the event, there must be at least one annotation set. 

Add, import, and edit annotation sets using `Event` settings.

Import an annotation set by selecting `Import` under the `Add` menu on an Event's page.

Import annotation sets by selecting a spreadsheet file. The imported set can also be set as the default annotation set for the event from this page.

Annotation sets can be deleted or renamed from the `Event` settings.

In the `Annotation Sets` settings, rename the set, select the associated AV file, and select the set as the captions source for the AV file. Optionally, a tag category for the speaker can also be selected from this page.

> Selecting an annotation set for an AV file's captions source does not work for YouTube, which has its own captioning system.
