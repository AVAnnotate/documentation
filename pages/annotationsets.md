# Annotation Sets

Annotation set is a group of annotations for a single AV file. In the end-user interface, visitors can filter annotations based on these sets. Annotation sets might be organized to include one for transcripts and another for notes, or one in English and another in Spanish, or one created by Manuel and another by Laura.

## Creating and Modifying Annotation Sets
When annotations are added to an event, AVAnnotate creates a 'Default' annotation set through `Event` settings.

{: .warning }
> The 'Default' annotation set can be renamed but cannot be deleted. If the user wants to delete the default annotation set (even when it is renamed), they must create a new set. Once annotations are added to the event, there must be at least one annotation set. 

- Add, import, and edit annotation sets using `Event` settings. [ADD PICTURE]

  - Imported sets by selecting a spreadsheet file.

  - Select an annotation set as a captions to a video file (note: this does not work for YouTube, which has its own captioning system). [ADD PICTURE]

  - Annotation sets can be deleted or renamed. [ADD DIFFERENT PICTURE]
