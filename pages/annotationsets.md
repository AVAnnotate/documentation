# Annotation Sets

Annotation sets are groups of annotations for a single av file. In the end user interface, visitors can filter annotations by the sets. Annotation sets might be organized to include one set for transcripts and another for notes; or one annotation set in English and another in Spanish; or one set created by Manuel and another created by Laura.  

# Creating and Modifying Annotation Sets
 
- By default, Annotation sets are first added to the 'Default' set through `Event` settings.

The 'Default' set can be renamed but cannot be deleted.
  
- Additional annotation sets can be uploaded under `Event` settings via a IIIF manifest, an imported spreadsheet, or .VTT file (Web Video Text Track file).
  
- After upload annotation sets can be set as captions on a video file (note: this does not work for YouTube, which has its own captioning system) by selecting the settings of an annotation set in the `Event` settings. 

Annotation sets for an event can be imported seperately by selecting a spreadsheet file.
