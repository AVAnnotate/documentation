# Collaborative Projects
AVAnnotate provides different options for collaboration, which include:

### Add Collaborator
The project creator can add another GitHub user via the project settings page. The added user has the ability to add, edit, and delete all project components. The additional collaborator will not have access to add additional project collaborators or [make a project private](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/private/).

### Collaborating via GitHub Organizations
Managing collaborators through a GitHub Organization allows multiple project authors to access any AVAnnotate project created under that account. One benefit of this approach is sustainability. An AVAnnotate project built via a GitHub Organization isn't owned by a single author but by the Organization itself. This way, an AVAnnotate project can support long-term initiatives or multi-institutional collaborations without the confusion of individual ownership.
