# Collaborative Projects
One of the affordances of AVAnnotate is that the application allows for users to collaborate on shared projects from their respective devices. AVAnnotate project authors have different options for collaboration, which include but are not limited to:

- Collaborating on a shared AVAnnotate project via "Add User," which gives all collaborators access to nearly the same editing interface as the project author.
- Collaborating through a GitHub organization by [managing GitHub collaborators](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/gh-collab/)
- Collaborating by importing IIIF manifests generated by existing AVAnnotate events into a larger, anthology-style AVAnnotate project.

While this list is not exhausive, these methods of collaboration have been successfully used to build AVAnnotate projects with two to twenty or more authors, such as the [RHE 306 Anthology](https://trentwintermeier.github.io/rhe-306-anthology/).
