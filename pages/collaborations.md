# Collaborative Projects
AVAnnotate provides different options for collaboration, which include:

### "Add User"
The project creator can add another GitHub user on the project settings page. The added user has the ability to add, edit, and delete all project components. The additional user will not have access to add project collaborators or [make a project private](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/private/).

### Collaborating via GitHub Organizations
By managing collaborators through a GitHub Organization, multiple project authors can have access to any AVAnnotate project built under that GitHub Organization account. One affordance of this method is sustainability. An AVAnnotate project built via a GitHub Organization isn't owned by one author but the Organization itself. In this way, an AVAnnotate project can support long-term initiatives or multi-institutional collaborations without the confusion of individual project ownership.
