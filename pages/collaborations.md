# Collaborations
Steps for including collaborators on projects:
1. Create a project. See "[Get Started](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/quickstart/)"
2. Determine the collaborator's GitHub username.
3. In the AVAnnotate dashboard, open the project settings and navigate to `users`, select `add`.
4. Enter the collaborator's GitHub username.
5. When the collaborator logs into the AVAnnotate dashboard, the project will appear under "Shared Projects."
