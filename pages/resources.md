# Resources

These resources contain different steps for developing individual and collaborative AVAnnotate projects, from transcript development to steps for teaching AVAnnotate in the college classroom.  

## Researching with AVAnnotate
In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the information is portrayed will influence a particular audience’s understanding of the audiovisual material being made available in an AVAnnotate project.
- How and if recordings have been made accessible online for a public audience influences how the recordings can be made accessible for playback (i.e., upload to the Internet Archive) in an AVAnnotate project.
