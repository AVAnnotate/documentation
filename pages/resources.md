# Resources

These resources contain different steps for developing individual AVAnnotate projects for research and teaching. Below are workflows for each, and the sub-pages of this section offer more in-depth instructions for developing transcription for research projects and collaborative teaching projects with AVAnnotate.


## Teaching with AVAnnotate
In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the annotations and index terms employed in the AVAnnotate project will help students critically engage with the AV.
- How the assignment is crafted to help students make an argument with AVAnnotate that reflects their understanding of the learning objectives.
