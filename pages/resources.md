# Resources

These resources contain different steps for developing individual AVAnnotate projects for research and teaching. Below are workflows for each, and the sub-pages of this section offer more in-depth instructions for developing transcription for research projects and collaborative teaching projects with AVAnnotate.

## Researching with AVAnnotate
In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the information is portrayed will influence a particular audience’s understanding of the audiovisual material being made available in an AVAnnotate project.
- How and if recordings have been made accessible online for a public audience influences how the recordings can be made accessible for playback (i.e., upload to the Internet Archive) in an AVAnnotate project.

## Teaching with AVAnnotate
In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the annotations and index terms employed in the AVAnnotate project will help students critically engage with the AV.
- How the assignment is crafted to help students make an argument with AVAnnotate that reflects their understanding of the learning objectives.
