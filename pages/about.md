# AVAnnotate
[Get Started](https://avannotate.netlify.app/){:.btn .btn-primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 

AVAnnotate uses free and open-source web tools to create static sites on GitHub for sharing context around AV artifacts. 
Archivists, librarians, researchers, teachers, and students use the AVAnnotate application to:
- generate IIIF manifests and an associated GitHub repository
- upload annotations and a URL to their AV item 
- present and share their timestamped notes, annotations, and contextual writing around AV artifacts

Researchers creating projects with AVAnnotate should read this documentation to assist with [Getting Started](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/), building a [Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/projects/), creating [Collaborations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/collaborations/), and viewing [Example Projects](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/examples/). 

# Project Components
