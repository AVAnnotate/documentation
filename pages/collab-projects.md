# Building Collaborative Projects
There are various methods for building collaborative projects. Here are some:
1. [Add a collaborator](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/add-collab/) to an existing project.
2. If a user is a member of a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations), [create a new project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/) by selecting that organization  or [create a new GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). Members with the appropriate permissions in that organization will all have access to any AVAnnotate repositories created in that organization through the `Shared Projects` tab on the AVAnnotate dashboard.
