# Annotations

Timestamps mark the start and end times of a specific point or segment of an AV artifact. Annotations refer to this point or range in the audio or video. They include information about the media, such as transcripts, captions, details about formal features (like shot sequence, volume, or lighting), historical or cultural context, environmental noises (like fans or car horns), or conceptual notes or themes, along with a variety of other possible topics.

Annotations must refer to a timestamped point in time or segment of AV. 
- Timestamps can be provided either in seconds or in hh:mm:ss format. They must include a start and an end time. The start and end times can specify a range or the same moment in time.
- Annotations and timestamps can be added, edited, or deleted through the AVAnnotate dashboard.
- Multiple annotations can be included for the same timestamp.
- A single annotation can span multiple timestamps.

# Creating, Modifying, and Deleting Annotations

Annotations always correspond to an associated event. To add annotations to an event in AVAnnotate, navigate to the `Events` dashboard and select an event.
