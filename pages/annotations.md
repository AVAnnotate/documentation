# Annotations and Timestamps

Timestamped annotations are added to each AV file. Annotations and timestamps are user-created and correspond to a point or range in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the media that might include a transcript; captions; information about formal features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises such as fans or car horns; or conceptual notes or themes. Annotations often include tags for indexing.

# Creating and Modifying Annotations, Timestamps, and Tags
Annotations must include timestamps and can include tags. 
- Timestamps are included in hh:mm:ss format and must have a start and end time. The start and end time can represent a range or be the same, as in a point in time.
- Annotations, timestamps can be added, edited, or deleted through the AVAnnotate dashboard.
- 
# Creating and Modifying Annotations Sets
AVAnnotate allows users to organize their annotations for AV files via different "sets" 
- Annotation sets can be added by hand or imported via a seperate spreadsheet or .VTT file (Web Video Text Track file). 
- Annotation sets can be set as captions on a video file (note: this does not work for YouTube, which has its own captioning system).

  - Annotation spreadsheets can be added to the default set or to a newly created set

- Annotation sets can be imported via IIIF manifests or created manually.
