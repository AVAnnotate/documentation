# Creating and Modifying Timestamped Annotations
Annotations must refer to a timestamped point in time or segment of AV. 
- Timestamps can be included in either seconds or in hh:mm:ss format and must have a start and end time. The start and end time can represent a range or be the same, as in a point in time.
- Annotations and timestamps can be added, edited, or deleted through the AVAnnotate dashboard.
- Multiple annotations can be included for the same timestamp or spanning timestamps.
