# AVAnnotate Glossary

**Annotation:** [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) are user-created and correspond to a point of time or a range of time in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the media. This information might include the words people say (the transcript or captions); descriptions of or historical and cultural context about what is happening on the media; information about features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; notes about the quality of the media; or conceptual notes or themes among a wide range of possible topics. 

**Annotation Set:** [Annotation sets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) refer to multiple sets of annotations that can be associated with a given media. Media that might refer to multiple sets of annotation could include one annotation set in English and one annotation set in Spanish or different annotation sets for transcripts and caption annotations. Collaborators might also upload different annotation sets for each collaborator. Tags and tag groups can be associated with particular annotation sets, and annotation sets can be filtered separately on the published site. 

**AV Items:** AV items in AVAnnotate refer to audiovisual moving-image or sound artifacts. In AVAnnotate, annotations are associated with timestamps that correspond to these time-based artifacts. AV items are playable in an AVAnnotate project when they have been digitized, are freely available online, and can be referenced [as links.](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/av/) AVAnnotate does not store AV items. While users can still create and display indexable, time-stamped annotations for “Offline Media” such as Analog AV artifacts and digital AV artifacts that are not available online, these media cannot be referenced via links and are therefore not playable in an AVAnnotate project. 

**Event:** The [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) refers to any occasion that the project creator seeks to present to an audience. Events are a central conceptual element of a project and could comprise a single or multiple AV files, which may be optionally associated with annotations. Events might include a conference of different panels and speakers or, more typically, a single speaker's presentation. In some scholarly use cases, an event could include different versions of a poet reading her poetry. In each case, the project creator determines the scope and defintion of their "events." 

**Index:** The index is a set of auto-generated pages that organizes and visualizes tag groups and tags across the project, allowing users to search, filter, and compare annotations, tags, and tag groups.

**Pages:** Pages are the building blocks of a project, and are either [auto-generated](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) or [custom generated.](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/) 

**Project:** The published project comprises the event(s) and page(s), and may also include annotations, tags, and an index. 

**Project Dashboard:** The project dashboard is the backend management site for projects under development. The dashboard allows users to create projects, select projects to edit, edit project details, collaborate, and publish projects. 

**Tag:** [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) are user-generated labels that allow indexing, organizing, and filtering topics in the annotations on the published site. 

**Tag Group:** Groups can be used to organize tags.
