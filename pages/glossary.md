# AVAnnotate Glossary

To familiarize users with AVAnnotate terms, this page serves as an AVAnnotate term glossary. 

**Annotation:** [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) are user-created and correspond to a point of time or a range of time in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the media that might include a transcript; captions; information about features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises, like fans or car horns; or conceptual notes or themes. Annotations  are optionally associated with tags, which allows for searching and indexing annotations across the project.

**Annotation Set:** [Annotation sets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) refer to multiple annotation files associated with a given media. An example of an AVAnnotate project featuring annotation sets is “Radio Venceremos” which includes one annotation set in English and one annotation set in Spanish. Tags and tag groups can be associated with particular annotation sets, and annotation sets can be filtered and toggled on/off individually on the published site. 

**Event:** An [event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) comprises single or multiple AV files, which may be optionally associated with annotations in a project. 

**Index:** The index is an auto-generated page that chronicles each page in a project. The index can be thought of as a table of contents for the project which allows users to search, filter, and compare annotations, tags, and tag groups.

**Pages:** Pages are the building blocks of a project, and are either [auto-generated](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) or [custom generated.](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/) 

**Project:** The project comprises the event(s) and page(s), and may also include annotations and tags. 

**Project Dashboard:** The project dashboard is the home site for projects under development. The dashboard allows users to select projects to edit; edit project details; and view completed and in progress projects. 

**Tag:** [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) are user-generated labels that allow indexing, organizing, and filtering topics in the annotations on the published site. 

**Tag Group:** Groups can be used to organize tags. Tag group examples can be found in the Index of any AVAnnotate project.
