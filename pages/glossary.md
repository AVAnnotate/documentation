# AVAnnotate Glossary

**Annotation:** [Annotations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) are user-created and correspond to a point of time or a range of time in the audio or video. Annotations contain information about the media that might include a transcript; captions; information about features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises, like fans or car horns; or conceptual notes or themes among a wide range of possible topics. Annotations are optionally associated with tags, which allows for searching and indexing annotations across a project.

**Annotation Set:** [Annotation sets](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/annotations/) refer to multiple sets of annotations that can be associated with a given media. Media that might refer to multiple annotation could include one annotation set in English and one annotation set in Spanish or different annotation sets for transcripts and caption annotations. Tags and tag groups can be associated with particular annotation sets, and annotation sets can be filtered separately on the published site. 

**Event:** An [Event](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/events/) comprises single or multiple AV files, which may be optionally associated with annotations in a project. 

**Index:** The index is a set of auto-generated pages that organizes and visualizes tag groups and tags across the project, allowing users to search, filter, and compare annotations, tags, and tag groups.

**Pages:** Pages are the building blocks of a project, and are either [auto-generated](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/auto/) or [custom generated.](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/custom/) 

**Project:** The published project comprises the event(s) and page(s), and may also include annotations, tags, and an index. 

**Project Dashboard:** The project dashboard is the backend management site for projects under development. The dashboard allows users to create projects, select projects to edit, edit project details, collaborate, and publish projects. 

**Tag:** [Tags](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tags/) are user-generated labels that allow indexing, organizing, and filtering topics in the annotations on the published site. 

**Tag Group:** Groups can be used to organize tags.
