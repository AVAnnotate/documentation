# AVAnnotate
[Get Started](quickstart){:.btn .btn-primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 

AVAnnotate uses free and open-source web tools (Jekyll and GitHub Pages) to create static sites on GitHub to share context around AV artifacts. 
Archivists, librarians, researchers, teachers, and students use the AVAnnotate application to
- generate IIIF manifests and an associated GitHub repository
- upload annotations and a URL to their AV item 
- present and share their timestamped notes, annotations, and contextual writing around AV artifacts
