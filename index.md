Audio and Video is Difficult to Search.

[AVAnnotate](https://av-annotate.org/) is a system for creating, organizing, and publishing collections of annotations for audio and video resources, making these artifacts easily discoverable and searchable.

Created by [Dr. Tanya Clement](https://tanyaclement.org/), [Brumfield Labs](https://www.brumfieldlabs.com/), and [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), AVAnnotate is a free and open source workflow and application for sharing annotations of audio and video artifacts and making digital exhibits and editions with AV materials.

[Example projects.](https://av-annotate.org/example-projects/)

Leveraging [IIIF](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/iiif/) and GitHub for sharing curated annotations of audiovisual materials held at libraries, archives, and museums, AVAnnotate allows users to combine metadata for online audio and video assets with user-generated annotations and contextual essays to create simple, playable web-based editions and exhibits.

The [Monster Mash Documentation Project](https://avannotate.github.io/mm/) is a sample project that demonstrates what kinds of pages users can make using AVAnnotate and is referenced from the AVAnnotate documentation.
