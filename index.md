## It's difficult to use audio and video in research and teaching. AVAnnotate makes it easier.
---
[AVAnnotate](https://av-annotate.org/) is an application for creating, organizing, and publishing collections of annotations for audio and video resources, making these artifacts easily discoverable and searchable.

This "Get Started" section outlines the basics of developing an AVAnnotate project, from foundational concepts to to helpful tips and tricks. The [quick start](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/quickstart/) offers a step-by-step guide to creating a project; the [glossary](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/glossary/) outlines the terms and concepts needed to work through a project while [features](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/features/) outlines what AVAnnotate can do; details about using GitHub are in [GitHub Accounts and Organizations](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/orgs/) and [helpful tips](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/tips/) and tricks are some things to consider before starting.

> AVAnnotate doesn't use generative AI in any way; projects are only comprised of the content that users generate and/or import. For example, AVAnnotate doesn't annotate an AV for the user, nor does it generate tags or transcripts for AV. Instead, it develops relationships between and displays user-generated data in an online, published project. 

The [Monster Mash Documentation Project](https://avannotate.github.io/mm/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a sample project that demonstrates what kinds of pages are possible for AVAnnotate project authors to make. The screenshots and visual how-to's throughout this documentation are based on the Monster Mash project, so audiences can view the how-to's (which visualize the back-end/editing interface) alongside the published project.
