## Audio and video is difficult to search. 


This "Get Started" section outlines the basics of developing an AVAnnotate project, from the foundational concepts to to helpful tips and tricks. The [quick start](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/quickstart/) offers a step-by-step; the [glossary](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/glossary/) outlines the terms and concepts needed to work through a project; details about uploading events and annotations are included in the [spreadsheet templates](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/templates/); and [helpful tips](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/troubleshooting/) and tricks are last. 

[AVAnnotate](https://av-annotate.org/) is a system for creating, organizing, and publishing collections of annotations for audio and video resources, making these artifacts easily discoverable and searchable.

Created by [Dr. Tanya Clement](https://tanyaclement.org/), [Brumfield Labs](https://www.brumfieldlabs.com/), and [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), AVAnnotate is a free and open source workflow and application for sharing annotations of audio and video artifacts and making digital exhibits and editions with AV materials.

The [Monster Mash Documentation Project](https://avannotate.github.io/mm/) is a sample project that demonstrates what kinds of pages are possible for AVAnnotate project authors to make. The screenshots and visual how-to's throughout this documentation are based on the Monster Mash project, so audiences can view the how-to's (which visualize the back-end/editing interface) alongside the published project.
